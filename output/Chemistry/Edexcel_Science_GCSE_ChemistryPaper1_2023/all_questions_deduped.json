The volume of ammonia solution required to neutralise 25 cm3 of dilute sulfuric acid is found by titration using an indicator. The results of the titration can be used to prepare a solution of ammonium sulfate. Pure, dry ammonium sulfate crystals can be made from this solution. Write a detailed method to make ammonium sulfate crystals starting with ammonia solution and dilute sulfuric acid.",
