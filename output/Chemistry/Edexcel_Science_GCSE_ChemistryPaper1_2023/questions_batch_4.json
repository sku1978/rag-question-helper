The method used was step 1 measure 200 cm3 dilute hydrochloric acid into a beaker, step 2 add 0.1 g of powdered calcium hydroxide to the beaker, step 3 find the pH of the mixture, step 4 repeat steps 2 and 3 until the pH stops changing. State what should be done after step 2 to make sure that any reaction is complete.",
