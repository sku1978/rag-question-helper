Figure 1 shows the chromatogram at the end of the experiment. The Rf value of a dye can be calculated using the equation Rf = distance moved by the dye / distance moved by solvent front. At the end of the chromatography one dye had moved 3.60 cm and the solvent front had moved 9.20 cm. Calculate the Rf value for this dye. Give your answer to 2 decimal places. Rf =",
