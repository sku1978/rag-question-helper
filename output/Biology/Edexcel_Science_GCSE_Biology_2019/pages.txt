1 (a)	 A scientist obtained a mass of 0.0062 nanograms of DNA from a diploid human cell.


Calculate the mass of DNA the scientist should obtain from a haploid human cell.


Give your answer in picograms.


(1 nanogram = 1000 picograms)
..............................................................

(b)	 A student used the method shown in Figure 1 to compare the mass of DNA
extracted from strawberry fruit cells and from kiwi fruit cells.
crush the fruit cells in a buffer solution
filter to separate the soluble DNA from the cell fragments
add ethanol

4 (a)	 Lactase is an enzyme that breaks down lactose into glucose and galactose.


A student made some alginate beads containing lactase.


The student added 10 beads to 20 cm 3 of a solution of lactose, as shown in Figure 4.


The student timed how long it took for glucose to be produced.


The experiment was repeated using 15, 20 and 25 beads.
