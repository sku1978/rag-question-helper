The student added 10 beads to 20 cm3 of a solution of lactose, as shown in Figure 4. The student timed how long it took for glucose to be produced. The experiment was repeated using 15, 20 and 25 beads. The results are shown in Figure 5. What is the rate of reaction for 25 beads? A 0.008 s\u22121 B 0.04 s\u22121 C 0.21 s\u22121 D 4.8 s\u22121",
