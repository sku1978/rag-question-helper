The graph in Figure 18 shows how the amount of electricity generated by these resources changed from 2012 to 2020. Explain how and why the amount of electricity generated by renewable and non-renewable energy resources has changed from 2012 to 2020. Your answer should include the trends shown in Figure 18, the change in the amount of electricity generated by at least one renewable resource, and the change in the amount of electricity generated by at least one non-renewable resource.",
